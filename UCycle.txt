	First thing first,we want to introduce you a new concept of collecting and recycling.This concept is about sensors in the collecting
points in order to see when it is time to empty.
	Also we would like to present some cool features like the map with the collecting points on it and how much(the percentage)of the
trash can is used.Another feature is the number of emptyings/month on a trash can in order to increase the density of collecting points in that area.
	The tools used for developing this app were JavaScript,HTML,CSS,Python and Github.
	Another useful feature is the user interaction which can help us to find out the needs of the community.The location of the user is really 
important because we created an algorithm that finds the closest collecting point to the user.
	We developed a site for the administrative staff from the city hall when they can see more statistics.
